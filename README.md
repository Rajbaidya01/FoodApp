# FoodApp
A full-stack food ordering web application built using React, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Lombok, MySQL, and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to browse food items, place orders, and manage their account. Backend APIs were tested and validated using Postman, and Maven was used for project management.
